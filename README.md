## Description:
EventExpo app allows users to reserve tickets for all kinds of events which include sports, harvesting, kayaking, painting, and many more. EventExpo allows users to host events. The major advantage of using the EventExpo app is to handle all the events together at one place where users can switch to different pages inside the app rather than opening a different app for each type of event resulting(results in) good user experience by using EventExpo App. Sign-Up the EventExpo and let the events add wings to your daily life.

## Main Feature:
Proposed an oppurtunity to Book different Categories and different kinds of Events like Kayaking, Painting, Cricket Online in single application.

## Risky Components:
##### Uses an outside API:
- The app will be hosted on an external API, i.e., Gennymotion. This will give us clearer idea about layout and navigation of the pages developed.
##### Requires Functionality NOT discussed:
- As we will be using Firebase for real-time data handling, it will be a bit difficult to navigate through this new functionalities, adding and retreiving data.
##### Requires Functionality will be discussed:
- Data base services and handling is yet to be understood and will be discussed later.
